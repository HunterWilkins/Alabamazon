# Alabamazon

Alabamazon is a Node spoof of Amazon. No, it's not related to alabama. I just thought it was funny.

Currently, there are only 10 products in the bamazon database.

The program (run by typing node bamaslama.js) gives you a prompt first after shoiwng you the products in the bamazon database. If you select "Yes," then you're asked which product you want to buy and how much of it. It then takes that information and subtracts the quantity selected (if it's less than what's in stock) from the stock quantity.
